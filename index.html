    <a name="cheetah"><section id="cheetah"><h2>Cheetah</h2><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah" target=_blank><img src=cheetah.jpg alt="Cheetah"></a><p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. Cheetahs typically reach 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3.6 and 4.9 ft). Adults typically weigh between 20 and 65 kg (44 and 143 lb). Its head is small, rounded, and has a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies are recognised.</p><p>To learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah">click here</a></p><p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p></section></a>
    <a name="leopard"><section id="leopard"><h2>Leopard</h2><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard" target=_blank><img src=leopard.jpg alt="Leopard"></a><p>The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in Morocco, leopard populations have already been extirpated. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.</p><p>To learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard">click here</a></p><p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p></section></a>
    <a name="lion"><section id="lion"><h2>Lion</h2><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion" target=_blank><img src=lion.jpg alt="Lion"></a><p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p><p>To learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion">click here</a></p><p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p></section></a>
    <a name="lynx"><section id="lynx"><h2>Lynx</h2><br><img src=lynx.jpg alt="lynx"></a><p>A lynx (/lɪŋks/; plural lynx or lynxes) is any of the four species (Canada lynx, Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx, bobcat) within the medium-sized wild cat genus Lynx. The name lynx originated in Middle English via Latin from the Greek word λύγξ, derived from the Indo-European root leuk- ('light, brightness') in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes.</p><p>To learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx">click here</a></p><p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p></section></a>
    <a name="panther"><section id="panther"><h2>Panther</h2><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther" target=_blank><img src=panther.jpg alt="Panther"></a><p>A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of any Panthera, particularly of the leopard (P. pardus) in Asia and Africa, and the jaguar (P. onca) in the Americas. Black panthers of both species have excess black pigments, but their typical spotted markings are also present. Melanism in the leopard is caused by a recessive allele, and in the jaguar by a dominant allele.</p><p>In 1788, Jean-Claude Delamétherie described a black panther, which was kept in the Tower of London and had been brought from Bengal. In 1794, Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer proposed the scientific name Felis fusca for this individual. In 1809, Georges Cuvier described a black leopard kept in the Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes that had been brought from Java. Cuvier proposed to name it Felis melas.</p><p>In 1801, Félix de Azara described a black jaguar observed by local people near the Paraná River in Paraguay.</p><p>To learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther">click here</a></p><p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p></section></a>
    <a name="tiger"><section id="tiger"><h2>Tiger</h2><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger target=_blank><img src=tiger.jpg alt= " Tiger"></a><p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.</p><p>The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.</p><p>To learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger">click here</a></p><p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p></section></a>
